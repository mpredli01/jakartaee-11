= Jakarta Data Demo Application

This project is a demonstration on how to use the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/data/[Jakarta Data] and https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/[Jakarta NoSQL] specifications. The application tracks craft beer and their corresponding brewers that are modeled in a https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] database.

// TODO: add links to Payara
Most of the REST applications can be deployed in a Jakarta EE-compliant application server, such as Payara Server and Payara Cloud.

== Example Application

The REST application can be packaged as follows:

`$ mvn clean compile package`

This will build a WAR file that may be dropped in any Jakarta EE-compliant application server.

== Deploying the WAR File

You can easily deploy the WAR file in Payara Micro as follows:

`java -jar <path-to>/payara payara-micro-6.2024.3.jar <path-to>/target/data-1.0.0.war`

== Executing the REST Application

You can point your browser to the http://10.0.0.229:8080/data-1.0.0/db[Welcome Page]

The Welcome Page contains the links to access the `/db/beer` and `/db/brewer` endpoints to get the current list of beers and brewers, respectively.

== Exercising the Application

To add a beer to the database, enter the following `curl` command in the terminal window:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"_id": <id>, "name": "Russian Imperial Stout", "type": "STOUT", "brewer_id": <id>, "abv": 10.2}' http://10.0.0.229:8080/beers/db/beer/<id>`

To add a brewer to the database, enter the following `curl` command in the terminal window:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"_id": <id>, "name": "Maine Beer Company", "city": "Freeport", "state": "Maine" }' http://10.0.0.229:8080/beers/db/brewer/<id>`

To delete a brewer from the database:

`curl -X DELETE http://172.20.1.228:8080/data-1.0.0/db/brewer/6`

Brewer and Beer to be added during Devnexus:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"_id": <id>, "name": "SweetWater Brewing Company", "city": "Atlanta", "state": "Georgia" }' http://10.0.0.229:8080/beers/db/brewer/<id>`

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"_id": <id>, "name": "420 Extra Pale Ale", "type": "IPA", "brewer_id": <id>, "abv": 5.7}' http://10.0.0.229:8080/beers/db/beer/<id>`


// TODO: add additional commands for other database operations


=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`

* https://data-demo-dev-67884e4b.payara.app/data/data/data[Main Application]

=== Testing
