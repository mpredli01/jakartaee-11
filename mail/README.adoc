== Example Application

This project is a demonstration on how to use the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/[Jakarta Mail] specification.

== Build the Application

`$ mvn clean compile package`

This will build a WAR file that may be dropped in any Jakarta EE-compliant application server.

== Deploy the Application

These examples may be deployed using any Jakarta EE-compliant application server. For these demos, I am using https://www.payara.fish/learn/getting-started-with-payara-micro/[Payara Micro]. It may be downloaded as a JAR file and executed as follows:

`$ java -jar <path>/payara-micro-<version>.jar target/mail-1.0.0.war`

Here, `<version>` is in the form of 6.2024.12 or 7.2024.1.Alpha2

A script, `start-payara-micro.sh` is included for your convenience. All you need to do is download Payara Micro

== Executing the Application

Upon successful deployment, the application may be executed in the browser:

http://localhost:8080/mail-1.0.0[Main Application]

== Testing

Please stay tuned for details...
