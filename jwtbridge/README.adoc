== Example Application

This project is a demonstration on how to use the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-bridge/blob/main/README.adoc[MicroProfile JWT Bridge] specification.

The application was modeled from a https://github.com/luiseufrasio/payara-vcon-jwt-demo/blob/full-secured/README.md[application] created by https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-neto-16786b227/[Luis Neto], Java Software Engineer at Payara. This was demonstrated at the Virtual Payara Conference in June 2024.

== Build the Application

`$ mvn clean compile package`

This will build a WAR file that may be dropped in any Jakarta EE-compliant application server.

== Deploy the Application

These examples may be deployed using any Jakarta EE-compliant application server. For these demos, I am using https://www.payara.fish/learn/getting-started-with-payara-micro/[Payara Micro]. It may be downloaded as a JAR file and executed as follows:

`$ java -jar <path>/payara-micro-<version>.jar target/jwtbridge-1.0.0.war`

Here, `<version>` is in the form of 6.2024.12 or 7.2024.1.Alpha2

A script, `start-payara-micro.sh` is included for your convenience. All you need to do is download Payara Micro

== Executing the Application

Upon successful deployment, the application may be executed in the browser:

http://localhost:8080/jwtbridge-1.0.0[Main Application]

`curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "username":"Mike", "password":"password" }' -X POST http://localhost:8080/jwtbridge-1.0.0/api/token/generate`

A JWT token will be generated and a script, `run.sh` will be created with the new token.

An example `curl` command is as follows:

`curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/jwtbridge-1.0.0/api/secured/hi-with-token -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJNaWtlIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiYWRtaW4iXSwiaXNzIjoicGF5YXJhIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM2ODkwMTAwfQ.5J_O40dmtPUCAH5MWgwXuiCV7HeTA7UfAFtsuS9dGDU"`

== Testing

Please stay tuned for details...
