This project is a demonstration on how to use the Jakarta Concurrency specification. The primary example application is a task creator that allows you to add tasks that are handled immediately or with a delay of three or eight seconds. A command-line application is also included that serves as a placeholder that displays a welcome screen.

== Application Server

These examples may be executed using any Jakarta EE-compliant application server.  Payara Micro is used for these demo applications. It is downloaded as a JAR file and executed as follows:

`$ java -jar <path>/payara-micro-6.2024.6.jar <path>/<warfile>.war`

A script, `start-payara-micro.sh` is included for your convenience. All you need to do is install Payara Micro

== Command-Line Application

The command-line application is currently a placeholder for a more comprehensive application. This `ConcurrencyApp` class is referenced in the `pom.xml` file as `<mainClass>org.redlich.concurrency.ConcurrencyApp</mainClass>`, so executing it is as easy as:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`

Upon executing this application, you will be presented with the following output on the terminal window:

[APP] ---------------------------------------------------------
[APP] Welcome to the Jakarta Concurrency Demo Application
[APP] ---------------------------------------------------------

== REST Application

The REST application was modeled after the Task Creator example from the comprehensive set of https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-examples/blob/main/README.md[Jakarta EE 10 Examples]. The `ConcurrencyApplication` class defines the `/jaxrs` endpoint and serves as the entry point of the application.

`$ mvn clean compile package`

This will build a WAR file that may be dropped in any Jakarta EE-compliant application server.

== Executing the REST Application

The REST application may be executed via:

https://concurrency-demo-dev-bfa859d4.payara.app/concurrency/[Main Application]

=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`

* https://concurrency-demo-dev-bfa859d4.payara.app/concurrency/[Main Application]

=== Testing

Please stay tuned for details...
