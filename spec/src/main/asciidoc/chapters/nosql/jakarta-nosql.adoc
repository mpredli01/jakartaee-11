== Jakarta NoSQL Example Application

=== Introduction

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/[Jakarta NoSQL] specification, currently at version 1.0-b7, streamlines the integration of Java applications with NoSQL databases. This specification defines a set of APIs and provides a standard implementation for most NoSQL databases.

The compatible implementation for this specification is https://www.jnosql.org/[Eclipse JNoSQL].

NOTE:: Jakarta NoSQL remains a standalone specification at this time. It is not part of the Jakarta EE Platform.

=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`
