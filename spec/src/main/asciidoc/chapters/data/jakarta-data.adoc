== Jakarta Data 1.0 Example Application

=== Introduction

The [Jakarta Data 1.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/data/1.0/) specification, currently under development, provides an API that allows easy access to database technologies. A Java developer can split the persistence from the model with several features, such as the ability to compose custom query methods on a Repository interface where the framework will implement it.

The Jakarta Working Group recently voted to include Jakarta Data in the Jakarta EE 11 Platform.
