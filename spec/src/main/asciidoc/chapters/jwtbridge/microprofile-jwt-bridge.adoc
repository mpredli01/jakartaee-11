== MicroProfile JWT Bridge Example Application

=== Introduction

The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-bridge#microprofile-jwt-bridge[MicroProfile JWT Bridge] specification, a collaboration between Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Working Groups, will enable a https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/[Jakarta Security] application to build on the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/blob/main/README.adoc[MicroProfile JWT Authentication] specification that provides seamless integrations to eliminate duplication of effort and circular dependencies. This will be a standalone specification under the auspices of MicroProfile.

=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`
