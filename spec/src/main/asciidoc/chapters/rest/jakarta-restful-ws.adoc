== Jakarta RESTful Web Services Example Application

=== Introduction

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services] specification, currently at version 3.1, provides a foundational API to develop web services following the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.

The compatible implementation for this specification is https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/[Eclipse Jersey 4.0.0].

Jakarta RESTful Web Services will be updated to version 4.0 for Jakarta EE 11. New features include:

* Define CDI scopes for all Jakarta REST types
* Define CDI integration and startup for Java SE applications
* Enhance discovery of application artifacts using CDI scanning
* Explore integration with Jakarta Concurrency
* Explore alignment with CDI lite and potentially built-time injection support

=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`

=== Testing
