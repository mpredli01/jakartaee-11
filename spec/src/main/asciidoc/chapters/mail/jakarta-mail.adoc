== Jakarta Mail Example Application

=== Introduction

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/[Jakarta Mail] specification, currently at version 2.1, provides a set of abstract classes defining objects that comprise a mail system with classes such as Message, Store and Transport.

The compatible implementation for this specification is https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/angus-mail/[Eclipse Angus Mail 2.0.2].

NOTE:: Jakarta Mail will not be updated for Jakarta EE 11.

=== Example Application

The application may be exercised by running the CLI version or deployed on Payara Cloud:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`
