== Jakarta Concurrency

=== Introduction

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/[Jakarta Concurrency] specification, currently at version 3.1 for Jakarta EE 11, provides a mechanism for using concurrency from application components without compromising container integrity while still preserving the fundamental benefits of the Jakarta EE platform

=== New Features

New features in version 3.1 include:

* Integration with JEP 444, https://openjdk.org/jeps/444[Virtual Threads], delivered in JDK 22
* Support for the Java https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html[`Flow`] class and the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators/blob/main/README.adoc[MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators] and https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators/blob/main/README.adoc[MicroProfile Context Propagation] specifications
* A new https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.concurrency/jakarta/enterprise/concurrent/schedule[`@Schedule`] annotation that replaces the original annotation defined in the now-retired Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification.
* Evolve to be more CDI-centric by adding the ability to inject default resource implementations of the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.concurrency/jakarta/enterprise/concurrent/managedexecutorservice[`ManagedExecutorService`] and https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.concurrency/jakarta/enterprise/concurrent/contextservice[`ContextService`] interfaces.
