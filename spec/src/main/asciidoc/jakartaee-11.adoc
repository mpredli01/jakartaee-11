== Jakarta EE 11 Specification Example Applications

This repository complements the presentation, Jakarta EE 11: Going Beyond the Era of Java EE, and provides example applications on some of the Jakarta EE specifications that will be updated for Jakarta EE 11.

The specifications shown here are:

* [Jakarta Data 1.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/data/1.0/)
* [Jakarta RESTful Web Services 4.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/)
* [Jakarta Validation 3.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/3.1/) (formerly known as Jakarta Bean Validation)

In addition, there are example applications for:

* [Jakarta Mail 2.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/2.1/) which will not have an update for Jakarta EE 11.
* [Jakarta NoSQL 1.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/1.0/) which was not included in the Jakarta EE 11 Platform.

Each example application can be executed on the corresponding command line with:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`

Please consider contributing to this GitHub repository if you have ideas for continuous improvement. This would be much appreciated!
