== Specifications Updated for Jakarta EE 11

This repository complements the presentations: Jakarta EE 11: Going Beyond the Era of Java EE; and A Developer's Guide to Jakarta EE 11, and provides example applications on some of the Jakarta EE specifications that will be updated for Jakarta EE 11.

The specifications shown here will have updates for Jakarta EE 11:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/data/1.0/[Jakarta Data 1.0]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 4.0]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/3.1/[Jakarta Validation 3.1] (formerly known as Jakarta Bean Validation)

In addition, there are example applications for specifications that will not have updates for Jakarta EE 11:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/2.1/[Jakarta Mail 2.1]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/nosql/1.0/[Jakarta Mail 2.1] which was not included in the Jakarta EE 11 Platform.

=== Example Applications

Each example application can be executed on the corresponding command line with:

`$ mvn clean compile exec:java`
